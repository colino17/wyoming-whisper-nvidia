# Wyoming Faster-Whisper Docker Container with Nvidia CUDA Support

## Compose File


## Purpose
Allows GPU acceleration of wyoming-faster-whisper tasks. Currently there seem to be issues with CUDA implementations of both the Rhasspy and LinuxServerIO containers. Once those issues are resolved I would recommend switching back to those official images.
